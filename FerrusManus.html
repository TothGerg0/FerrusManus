     <h1>Ferrus Manus</h1>
    <p>
        "Rest? We were not made to rest; we go on, unflinching, unstoppable, unending in our strength. The Emperor did not make us for such mortal concerns as hearth and home, vanity or contemplation; we are his engines of war, his hammers, beating out the fabric of existence into a vessel fit for Mankind to inhabit."
    </p>
    <p>
        â€” Ferrus Manus, as quoted in Shadow of the Gorgon by the Remembrancer Czel Atternus
