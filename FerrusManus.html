                "Rest? We were not made to rest; we go on, unflinching, unstoppable, unending in our strength. The Emperor did not make us
                for such mortal concerns as hearth and home, vanity or contemplation; we are his engines of war, his hammers,
                beating out the fabric of existence into a vessel fit for Mankind to inhabit."
            </p>
            <p>
                â€” Ferrus Manus, as quoted in Shadow of the Gorgon by the Remembrancer Czel Atternus
